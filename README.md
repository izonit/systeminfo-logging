# systeminfo-logging | [Source](https://github.com/izonit/systeminfo-logging/)

** A really slow CLI system info logging tool - written in JS.**
*I didn't create it for others to use - it's just a way to familiarize me with creating NPM tools and packages.*
*Even though I don't recommend using it, if you do: I would be grateful if you give me tips on how to optimize or make the tool better!*

## Usage
**Run** `npx systeminfo-logging` - **installing the package will do practically nothing.**
If you wish to use it globally, run `npm i systeminfo-logging -g` to install the package script globally on your machine. To test it, start a new terminal session in a desired directory and run `sysinfo` - in this case, exactly `sysinfo` and not `systeminfo-logging`.
It is advised to have the latest Node.js version.

## TODO
- Optimize it so it runs for as fast as 0.5 seconds, if possible, even less
- Grow the project further
